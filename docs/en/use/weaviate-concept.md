# Weaviate Concept

> SHORT DESCRIPTION OF THIS DOC

Weaviate is a [Decentralised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer) [Semantic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web) [Knowledge Graph](https://hackernoon.com/wtf-is-a-knowledge-graph-a16603a1a25f). It allows for different nodes in a network to share knowledge from each node's individual graph.

What makes Weaviate unique;<br>
- Weaviate is plug & playable because it uses industry standards like [RESTful API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)'s and [GraphQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GraphQL).
- Every Weaviate can have a 100% unique ontology.
- [Can be connected](#user-content-database-connector--graph-interface) to any database of choice to solve specific use cases ([consistency, availability and/or partition tolerance wise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem)).
- Based on [word embedings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding) to give context to [M2M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_to_machine) communication over the network.
